However, this time the battle has been waged not for the champion’s title, but rather for the third and fourth place in the tournament table.</p><p>C9 has made the first step towards their win during the champion selection. Namely, they’ve chosen the comp of Viego, Yone, Kalista, Diana, and Rakan. This way, Liquid could never stay under the protection of the turret.

This guaranteed the team the Baron on the 23rd minute, which was the next important step towards the win. Another memorable moment that pushed Liquid towards losing was a bug that prevented Jensen from casting Q and E to get away from the enemy team, which put the game on pause.</p><p>This loss for Liquid marks the final nail in their coffin, dropping them far behind third place at 19-13. With Zven coming back into the game, C9 feels reinvigorated and seems to be doing well with a score of 21-11.</p><p>We will see the teams clash together once again this week, and C9 will later pursue their other opponents in TSM to get a chance of earning second place in the tournament.</p>"

C9 lacked the vision on the river, but they’ve pushed the side lanes and waited for Liquid to push to the drake. That’s why they were prepared and have met Liquid with the ult from Blaber’s Diana combined with pulling from Kalista. This guaranteed the team the Baron on the 23rd minute, which was the next important step towards the win. Another memorable moment that pushed Liquid towards losing was a bug that prevented Jensen from casting Q and E to get away from the enemy team, which put the game on pause.</p><p>This loss for Liquid marks the final nail in their coffin, dropping them far behind third place at 19-13. With Zven coming back into the game, C9 feels reinvigorated and seems to be doing well with a score of 21-11.</p><p>We will see the teams clash together once again this week, and C9 will later pursue their other opponents in TSM to get a chance of earning second place in the tournament.</p>"

Sources claim that the promotions were paid and that FaZe Banks even had the status of the brand ambassador (before ending his deal). The degree to which Kay was involved in these dealings is yet uncertain.</p><p>In addition to Kay's termination, FaZe Clan conducted measures against Jarvis, Teeqo, and Nikan. They were reportedly involved in another machination concerning the “savethekids.io” coin. With the denunciation of their involvement, FaZe Clan has also stated that they have no agency over what the members do in the crypto industry.</p><p>Kay has also made a statement regarding the incident on his personal Twitter page. According to him, there was no malicious intent behind the promotions, he simply trusted the project. He claimed that he didn’t discuss his intent with his FaZe team, and he should’ve looked closely into the project before investing and promoting it.</p>"
